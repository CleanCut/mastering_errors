# Mastering Errors in Rust

This repository is the `errors` exercise extracted from [Ultimate Rust 2]. You will get the most out of this training experience by doing the exercise in this repository and watching (or attending) the instructor-led training.

In other words, this repository is for you hands-on-learners!

I use macOS, and that is what I developed this course on.  Everything _ought_ to work similarly on major Linux distributions and Windows. Please [contact me](mailto:nathan@agileperception.com) ASAP if you have trouble with anything on this page.

## Install Rust & Prepare Your Development Environment

Rust is required for this course!  The latest stable version is always recommended. See [the repository for the previous course] for instructions on how to install Rust, prepare your development environment, and helpful resources.

## Exercise

Please clone this repository! This exercise is designed as a Rust project for you to edit on your own computer.
